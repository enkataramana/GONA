    <h1>Under Weight Treatment</h1><hr>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Underweight individuals may be advised to gain weight by increasing calorie intake. This can be done by eating a sufficient volume of sufficiently calorie-dense foods.<br> Body weight may also be increased through the consumption of liquid nutritional supplements.</p>

     <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Another way for underweight people to gain weight is by exercising, since muscle hypertrophy increases body mass. Weight lifting exercises are effective <br>in helping to improve muscle tone as well as helping with weight gain. Weight lifting has also been shown to improve bone mineral density, which <br> underweight people are more likely to lack.</p>
    <p>Exercise is catabolic, which results in a brief reduction in mass. However, during recovery, anabolic overcompensation causes the muscles to grow, which <br>results in an overall increase in mass. This can happen through an increase in muscle proteins, or through enhanced storage of glycogen in muscles.<br>Exercise can also help stimulate the appetite of a person who is not inclined to eat</p>

    <h2>Appetite stimulants</h2>
    <p>Certain drugs may increase appetite either as their primary effect or as a side effect. Antidepressants, such as mirtazapine or amitriptyline, and <br> antipsychotics, particularly chlorpromazine and haloperidol, as well as tetrahydrocannabinol (found in cannabis), all present an increase in appetite as a <br>side effect. In states where it is approved, medicinal cannabis may be prescribed for severe appetite loss, such as that caused by cancer, AIDS, or severe<br> levels of persistent anxiety. Other drugs or supplements which may increase appetite include antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine, promethazine or cyproheptadine).</p>
