    <h1>BODY MASS INDEX</h1>
    <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
    <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a numerical value calculated based on a person's weight and height. It is a widely used tool to estimate whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. BMI is not a direct measurement of body fat, but it is used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight categories.</p>

    <h2>Basic Formula</h2>
    <p>The first formula we've listed is the metric BMI formula, using kilograms and meters. The second one is the imperial BMI formula, which uses units of pounds and inches. Converters are available for kilos to stone, kilos to pounds and ounces and pounds, should you need them.</p>

    <h2>Using the BMI formula (metric units)</h2>
    <p>These simple steps will help you work out your BMI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiply your height in meters (m) by itself</li>
        <li>Divide your weight in kilograms (kg) by your step 1 result</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example using formula</h3>
    <p>For an adult with a height of 180 cm and weight of 75 kg. Our first step needs to be to convert the height into meters. As there are 100 cm in a meter, we divide our figure by 100. This gives us 1.8 m.</p>

    <p>Let's plug those figures into our formula:</p>
    <p>BMI = 75 ÷ (1.8 × 1.8)</p>
    <p>BMI = 75 ÷ 3.24</p>
    <p>This gives us a BMI figure of 23.15.</p>

    <h2>Using the imperial BMI formula</h2>
    <p>Simple steps to work out your imperial BMI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiply your height in inches (in) by itself</li>
        <li>Divide your weight in pounds (lbs) by your step 1 result</li>
        <li>Multiply the result from step 2 by 703.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example using formula</h3>
    <p>For an adult with a height of 5ft 11 inches and weight of 155 pounds (lbs). Step one is to convert the height into inches only. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we simply multiply the 5ft by 12 and then add the 11 inches. This gives us a total of 71 inches.</p>

    <p>Let's plug those figures into our formula:</p>
    <p>BMI = 703 × (155 ÷ (71 × 71))</p>
    <p>We do the multiplication inside the brackets first:</p>
    <p>BMI = 703 × (155 ÷ 5041)</p>
    <p>And then...</p>
    <p>BMI = 703 × 0.030747867</p>
    <p>This gives us a BMI figure of 21.62.</p>
